# ES 6 Modules: Dashboard

A quick example how to create, bundle and load ES 6 modules with [jspm](jspm.io).
The result is a dashboard, containing 2 self-written modules where one is making use of [Moment Timezone](http://momentjs.com/timezone/) to demonstrate the usage of npm modules.

## Requirements

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)


## Installation

- clone this repository
- cd into the projects root dir
- ´´npm install´´

To serve the project the quickest and certainly most elegant way is jspm-server:
- ´´npm install -g jspm-server´´ 
- Execute ´´jspm-server´´ in the projects root dir to serve
